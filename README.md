OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND REVENUE ANALYSIS: SILVERLINE MEDICAL CENTRE HEALTHCARE DATASET

OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND REVENUE ANALYSIS: SILVERLINE MEDICAL CENTRE HEALTHCARE DATASET
Technical Report

1. Introduction

Objective of the Project:
This project aimed to perform a comprehensive operational and financial analysis of patient flow, consultation delays, and revenue streams for Silverline Medical Centre, a healthcare service provider. The key objective was to derive actionable insights to enhance service efficiency, maximize resource allocation, and boost profitability.

Problem Being Addressed:
The facility needed to understand patient volume patterns, identify bottlenecks causing consultation delays, evaluate revenue distribution across financial classes, and assess doctor efficiency. Addressing these issues is crucial for improving patient satisfaction, reducing wait times, and increasing profitability.

Key Datasets and Methodologies:
- Datasets: Patient visitation logs, financial transactions, doctor allocation records.
- Methodologies: Data cleaning, descriptive statistics, trend analysis, and visualization using Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Advanced Formulas, Time Analysis, KPI Dashboards).

2. Story of Data

Data Source:
Internal operational and financial data collected from Silverline Medical Centre’s electronic health records.

Data Collection Process:
Data was gathered automatically from patient registration, consultation logging, and financial transaction systems.

Data Structure:
- Rows: Individual patient visits and financial transactions.
- Columns: Patient demographics, doctor type, visit time, consultation start time, consultation wait time, financial class, revenue, and other KPIs.

Important Features and Their Significance:
- Consultation Wait Time: Measures operational efficiency and patient service quality.
- Doctor Type: Assesses workload distribution and efficiency.
- Financial Class: Tracks revenue streams and patient affordability.
- Visit Time & Hour: Identifies peak operational hours and staffing needs.

Data Limitations or Biases:
- Missing timestamps in some records.
- Potential outlier consultation delays not excluded in initial analysis (but reviewed during cleaning).
- Financial class categorizations may not fully capture patient socioeconomic diversity.

3. Data Splitting and Preprocessing

Data Cleaning:
- Removed duplicate records.
- Corrected inconsistencies in doctor type labels.
- Standardized time formats for accurate time-based analysis.

Handling Missing Values:
- Missing consultation start times were flagged. Records with critical missing data were excluded from certain time-based analyses.

Data Transformations:
- Created variables for hour of visit, day of week, and consultation delay buckets.
- Calculated derived KPIs such as average consultation wait time and doctor efficiency ratios.

Data Splitting:
- Dependent Variables: Consultation wait time, revenue.
- Independent Variables: Doctor type, visit hour, patient financial class.

Industry Context:
Healthcare operations analysis focusing on patient flow optimization and financial performance.

Stakeholders:
Operations management, financial planners, healthcare administrators.

Value to the Industry:
Insights from this project can guide healthcare facilities to optimize resource use, enhance patient satisfaction, and improve revenue forecasting.

4. Pre-Analysis

Identify Key Trends:
- Noticeable consultation delays during mid-day and early afternoon hours.
- Certain doctor types consistently handled more patients with varying efficiency levels.

Potential Correlations:
- Peak patient volume correlated with increased consultation delays.
- Revenue peaks aligned with higher patient volumes but not necessarily with faster service times.

Initial Insights:
Efficiency appeared to vary significantly between doctor types, suggesting possible process or staffing improvements.

5. In-Analysis

Unconfirmed Insights (Hypotheses):
- Doctors with higher patient loads might have either longer consultation delays or higher efficiency based on specialization.
- Financial class distribution may impact revenue predictability.

Recommendations (Preliminary):
- Explore scheduling adjustments to reduce mid-day bottlenecks.
- Rebalance doctor workload where feasible.

Analysis Techniques Used:
- Pivot Tables for slicing data by doctor type, hour, financial class.
- Advanced Formulas (VLOOKUP, IF statements) for cleaning and transforming data.
- Time Series Analysis to assess trends by hour/day.

6. Post-Analysis and Insights

Key Findings:
- Peak Consultation Hours: 10 AM to 2 PM, correlating with the highest consultation delays.
- Doctor Efficiency: Significant variation found, with some doctor types maintaining low delays despite higher patient volume.
- Revenue Streams: Financial Class A contributed the majority of revenue despite lower patient counts, highlighting a premium service segment.
- Wait Time Impact: Longer wait times were linked to decreased patient return rates (observed indirectly via patient volume trends).

Comparison with Initial Findings:
While initial assumptions suggested uniform efficiency, analysis revealed distinct performance patterns by doctor type and time of day.

7. Data Visualizations & Charts


8. Recommendations and Observations

Actionable Insights:
1. Staff Scheduling: Increase staff or redistribute doctor workloads during 10 AM – 2 PM to reduce delays.
2. Premium Services Strategy: Enhance offerings for Financial Class A patients while identifying upsell opportunities for other classes.
3. Process Optimization: Implement workflow changes for doctor types with higher delays.

Optimizations or Business Decisions:
Adopt flexible staffing models, evaluate patient flow processes, and consider dynamic scheduling.

Unexpected Outcomes:
Some doctors demonstrated high efficiency under heavy loads, suggesting opportunities for knowledge sharing or procedural standardization.

9. Conclusion

Key Learnings:
Operational efficiency varies significantly by doctor type and time of day. Revenue concentration in premium service segments presents strategic growth opportunities.

Limitations:
Data gaps in some time records and potential sample bias in financial class reporting.

Future Research:
A deeper dive into patient satisfaction metrics and exploring machine learning for predictive scheduling could enhance future analyses.
